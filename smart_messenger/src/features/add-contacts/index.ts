import AddContacts from "./AddContacts";

export { AddContacts };


// The index.ts file serves as the entry point for exporting the AddContacts component.
// It exports AddContacts to enable its use in other parts of the application without exposing its internal implementation.
// This pattern promotes encapsulation and modularization, allowing developers to import and use AddContacts component easily.
// By exporting components in this manner, the codebase maintains organization and facilitates scalability and maintainability.

import ChatBox from "./ChatBox";

export { ChatBox };


// The index.ts file serves as the entry point for exporting components related to chat functionality.
// It exports ChatBox, making it available for use in other parts of the application without exposing its internal implementation.
// This modular approach promotes encapsulation and ease of integration, allowing other components or modules to import and utilize chat-related features seamlessly.
// By exporting components in this manner, the codebase maintains organization and facilitates scalability and maintainability of chat-related functionalities.
